Thanks for trying my game!

All assets were made by me (other than music and SFX. Am I gonna get in trouble for that? :P).
I am not an artist, that is evident, but I just want to point that out!

There are some functional bugs. Using the arrow ability from the ground can be really messy, and sticking into stuff doesn't always work
I should really add an indication for which things can even be stuck into...
